# Cline Rules for Aurora Android App

## Build & Testing Behavior

**DO NOT attempt to build the project or run tests.**
- The development environment has specific setup requirements that make automated builds/tests unreliable
- The developer will manually run all builds and tests during their review and appropriation phase
- Focus on code generation, file modifications, and analysis only
- When work is complete, do not suggest or execute build/test commands in the completion step

## Documentation & Comments

**Add KDoc/JavaDoc documentation for:**
- Public methods and functions
- Complex or non-obvious logic that requires explanation
- Methods with non-trivial parameters or return values

**DO NOT add inline comments that:**
- Simply restate what was discussed in conversation (e.g., "// Adding an additional check on the data here")
- Describe obvious code behavior
- Serve as conversation artifacts rather than code documentation

**Philosophy:** Documentation should add value for future developers, not echo our implementation discussion.
