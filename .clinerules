# Cline Rules for Aurora Android App

## Build & Testing Behavior

**DO NOT attempt to build the project or run tests (unless specifically requested).**
- The development environment has specific setup requirements that make automated builds/tests unreliable
- The developer will manually run all builds and tests during their review and appropriation phase
- Focus on code generation, file modifications, and analysis only
- When work is complete, do not suggest or execute build/test commands in the completion step

**When executing Gradle commands (if specifically requested):**
- Each command runs in a fresh terminal without inheriting shell environment variables
- MUST explicitly set JAVA_HOME to Java 17 when running Gradle tasks
- Use this pattern: `JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openjdk@17/17.0.17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home ./gradlew [task]`
- The default system Java (25) is incompatible with the Kotlin tooling in Gradle 8.14.3

**Philosophy:** Environment setup is critical. Gradle commands require explicit Java 17 configuration to function properly.

## Documentation & Comments

**Add KDoc/JavaDoc documentation for:**
- Public methods and functions
- Complex or non-obvious logic that requires explanation
- Methods with non-trivial parameters or return values

**DO NOT add inline comments that:**
- Simply restate what was discussed in conversation (e.g., "// Adding an additional check on the data here")
- Describe obvious code behavior
- Serve as conversation artifacts rather than code documentation

**Philosophy:** Documentation should add value for future developers, not echo our implementation discussion.

## File Change Handling

**When files have been modified since your last edit:**
- DO NOT automatically revert changes to what you remember from earlier in the conversation
- Assume the developer has made purposeful edits as part of the collaborative process
- If you notice a change that seems detrimental or problematic, ask about it and voice your concern
- Discuss any concerning changes before making modifications

**Philosophy:** Respect the iterative nature of our collaboration. File changes between edits are intentional unless proven otherwise.
